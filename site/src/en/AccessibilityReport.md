_Canadian Digital Service_

This report describes the conformance of the COVID Alert mobile app with the [W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). This review process is based on the evaluation process described in [Accessibility Evaluation Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/).

Based on this evaluation, the COVID Alert mobile app is close to meeting WCAG 2.1, Conformance Level AA. Detailed review results will be available shortly. Feedback on this evaluation is welcome.

Conformance evaluation of this mobile app’s accessibility incorporated a combination of semi-automated evaluation tools and manual evaluation by an experienced team of accessibility testers. It was also informed by accessibility related feedback from people with disabilities using both informal and formal methods. Inclusive design reviews were conducted with the product team to ensure best practices were being followed, and that insights from research were iterated on and presented within the app. The evaluation results in this report are based on evaluation conducted prior to launch. The app may have changed since that time. This document will be updated frequently to reflect the current status of the app.

Read our [Accessibility Statement](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/accessibility-statement.html) for the current accessibility status and known issues of COVID Alert, as well as our approach to accessibility.
