# COVID Alert Decision Framework 

## Executive summary 

This document outlines how we prioritize the work on COVID Alert. As COVID Alert is one tool of many to slow the spread of COVID-19, this product needs to respond to the changing landscape of the pandemic. This framework provides alignment across those working on it on how we prioritize what we work on next. 

## What is an agile product backlog? 

A product backlog is a tool used in agile development to track and evaluate new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure changes or other activities that a team may deliver in order to achieve a specific outcome.

*   **Flexible and ever-changing:** as we learn new insights, the priority and order of the items in the backlog may change.
*   **Needs-based:** Items in this backlog are based on the needs of public health and people using the app. 
*   **Defined by priority level, not timelines:** We release features when they’re ready - no sooner, no later. 

This backlog is reassessed on a regular basis, and we can provide updates on this in a two week cadence. This cadence aligns with the sprint schedule of the team. 

## Governance and process

Governance of the Exposure Notification service is shared across several bodies, managed jointly by Health Canada and the Canadian Digital Service:

## How do features move through the CDS product development team?

From the very onset of this service, we have used this process and decision framework to make any and all decisions on features, changes, bug fixes and infrastructure changes to the app. 

All of these phases are a collaborative effort between Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Digital Service. We also seek guidance from external partners like provinces and territories, Advisory council etc throughout as well.

## Decision process

Any time we add a new feature to the app, it is **triaged, prioritized and analyzed**. Below is a detailed outline of how backlog items make their way through this process, and ultimately how it is decided what is implemented into the app. 

**All of these decisions are a collaborative effort between Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Digital Service.**

### Step One: Triage

Requests for features or changes to the app come in through one of the many channels into the team. These channels include: 

*   Public health needs & guidance (via SAC, FPT)
*   Support & feedback channels 
*   User research findings & insights 
*   Apple & Google updates 
*   Technical/design open source channels 

When features come in through any of these channels, we’re always focused on the desired outcome. Once we understand the desired outcome, the team then prioritizes it against current and ongoing work. Research and healthcare needs steer the product and service decisions. 

### Step Two: Prioritize 

Once the desired outcome is understood, the team then prioritizes the backlog item against current and upcoming work, using 4 main criteria:

*   Public health: Is this a public health priority?
*   User need: Do we have proof users need this / are we solving the right problem?
*   Urgency: Is this a fix that needs to happen right away?
*   In debt: Do we need to do this to keep the product running smoothly?

Once an item is prioritized, it either gets worked on right away (urgent fixes) or is put into the backlog for the team to work on. Once an item reaches high priority, the item is analyzed for feasibility, viability, impact and user need.

_** Note: if the backlog item doesn’t meet any of these criteria, it will likely not move forward beyond this stage. It will be moved into the “parking lot” until the team has a clear understanding of the desired outcome that aligns with the product strategy._

### Step Three: Analyze

When conducting an analysis of a backlog item, we look at it from a few different lenses: 

*   **Uptake:** _How might this impact trust, accessibility, availability, awareness or understanding of the service?_
*   **Functionality:** _How might this impact the core functionality of the service, including guidance and detection?_
*   **Impact and size:** _What is the scope of this change, and who needs to be involved?_

While analyzing features, we work with both internal teams at HC, PHAC and CDS, as well as external stakeholders such as provinces and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.

Once the feature has been analyzed, we decide whether the team should move forward with a feature, and how to proceed. If a decision cannot be reached on whether something should move forward or not, we consult others such as the Advisory Council, PCO, and OPC.
